        <h2>Daily Practices & Scrum Ceremonies</h2>
        <p>In this page, Dan introduces the topic of a Scrum event and the different kinds of Scrum meetings.</p>
        <h3>Scrum Ceremonies:</h3>
        <button class="accordion">Daily Standup</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The daily standup is a very short 15 minute timeboxed meeting. The Scrum Master will ask the developers will ask the three questions: What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? and, Do you have any blockers? This meaning is held everyday.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Sprint Planning</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The sprint planning meeting is held right before the new Sprint begins. During this meeting, the team discusses the Sprint gaol and what items to work on in the backlog. Each developer has a chance to ask questions if they have any about the work they will be taken on. Usually, this meeting is one to two hours, depending on how big the team is.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Backlog Refinement</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>This is a meeting, usually hosted by the product owner. The product owner goes along stories in the backlog to refine and size the developers. This is a meeting to see what the stories' definition of done is. Developers are also to vote on how many story points the story will have. Teams can chose how many times they want this meeting throughout a Sprint.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Sprint Retrospective</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The retrospective is held at the end of the sprint. The team meets to dicuss feedback that they have about the sprint they just work through. Developers will dicuss what went right, what went wrong, and what are the action items needed. This is also a good time for the team members to thank each other. This meeting usually take one to two hours as well.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Sprint Review</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The sprint review is a meeting that is held at the end of a sprint. The developers show what they worked on to key stakeholders and project managers. This is so the developers can get feedback from stakeholders about their work. Then, the team and stakeholders dicuss what are the next step. This is one to two hours.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How does the Scrum team functionality?</h3>
        <p>A Scrum Team works in timeboxed increments called sprints. Sprints ususally last two weeks or a month. It depends on the company or the team on how long they want their sprints to be. Before the sprint begins, the Product Owner speaks with project managers and/or stakeholders about project work that they would like the team to work on. Once a project is decided, the team will break down the project into smaller pieces call "stories". Stories are pieces of the bigger project. Stories are usually development tasks that are created by usually the Product Owner, and refined by the development team. The work of the story is represented by a number called "Story Points". Story Points are an evaulation of the complexity, duration of work, potential impediments, etc.. The story points are decided by the development team and are in a Fibonacci sequence (1,2,3,5,8). The lesser the number, the less complex it is. After the stories are refined and sized, the stories are held in the backlog which is a collection of future work that will be take on in later sprints. Then finally during the Sprint Planning ceremony, the team will decide what the goal for the sprint is. Once the goal is decided, the developement team will decide what stories thet will take on during the new sprint. The developers wil thus work on these stories and do their best to close the stories out by end of sprint.</p>
