        <h3>What Makes a Scrum Team?</h3>
        <p>A Scrum team consist of three different pivotal roles. The Scrum Master, the Product Owner, and the Engineer/Developer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Scrum Master:</b> The coach of the team. They faciliate the Scrum ceremonies, makes sure that they are not any blockers from stopping the team from working, and teaches a Scrum team about Scrum. The Scrum Master works with the product owner that the team is following the goals.</li>
            <li><b>Product Owner:</b> The product owner is the bridge of the development team and the business side. They teach the Scrum team about the product and keeps an eye of the team to make sure they are reaching the goal of the product. They also create user stories (the project work) for the developers to work on during the sprint. They also managed the backlog by priority.</li>
            <li><b>Engineer/Developer:</b> The development team are the ones who do the coding work. They help decide on what to work on and set the goal of the sprint. The development team are the ones who work together on making sure they provide feedback on each other.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advice about being a better team player:</h3>
        <p>In Dan's experience, he has realize to be the best Scrum Master, is to put your team first. EVerything you do as a Scrum Master must be in favor of the team. You have to make sure you are not too strict but also assertive so the team is following the correct Scrum principals. A weak Scrum Master causes disorganization and a lack of team collaboration. Without a strong Scrum Master, a team is doomed.</p>
