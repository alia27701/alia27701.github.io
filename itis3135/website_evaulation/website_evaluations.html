        <ul>
            <li><b>Contrast:</b> The text size of this website is too similar to each other so it is hard to tell what is the title or body text of the website.</li>
            <li><b>Repetition:</b> The text color is not consistent as it randomly changes from black to blue. Throughout the website, different fonts are used as well, making the website not cohesive at all.</li>
            <li><b>Alignment:</b> The website is very sloppy as the text are too close to each other so most of the time, it is very hard to read and you are reading a wall of text.</li>
            <li><b>Proximity:</b> The text for the website is way to cluttered so it is hard to tell if the sections are related or not.</li>
