            <p >Hello, welcome to my hobby website. In this page, I will be talking about my hobby, which is drawing, and why I enjoy it.</p>
            <p >I am sure drawing needs no introduction as we all probably done it, whenever it be for art class or bored in another class, we have all drawn something in our life. But, for the people that don't know, the concept of drawing is where you create an image with a tool, usually with pen and paper or on a phone with your finger. For me, I like to draw cartoons and manga characters, either already create or my very own, and try to either perfect their artstyles or give them their own little stories, especially with my own characters. In the next paragraph, I will talk about why I like to draw cartoons and manga as a hobby.</p>
            <p >For me, I really enjoy drawing because it lets me be as creative as I want. When I draw, it allows me to express my ideas and creative thinking on a piece of paper or on a screen if I am drawing digitally. By drawing, I am able to come up with different characters with many stories about them and even already existing characters with a different story about them and the best part, I won't be judge for thinking about them like that as I do it in private. If I am feeling brave enough, I like to share my drawings and usually I get praised for them. There are some people who will talk about what they do not like about my art, but it is fine because I used that as a learning experience to pratice drawing better.</p>

            <p >Hello, my name is Ali Alimi, and I enjoy drawing. I have been drawing ever since I was 3 years old when my parents got me one of those Fisher-Price Doodle Pro drawing board. For years, I would spent hours drawing on that board and making up my own characters and stories. When I got older and outgrew that board, I started drawing on paper and started to create my own comic series. As I got older, I started to experiment with drawing by drawing with different art styles and even started to draw digitally. As for today, I am able to draw effectively both on paper and digitally as well.</p>
            <p >For me, I really enjoy drawing in the manga/anime art style as it is the art style that looks the best in my opinion. </p>

            <h2>Best Times to Draw</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/ScaringCrow.png" alt="scare crow drawing">
                <figcaption><em>Drawing of a scarecrow that I drew during the month of October.</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p >Depending on who you ask, there are no exact better times to draw. One great part to take drawing as a hobby is that you are free to draw whenever you like, no matter what time or day. You can draw in the morning time you just woke up or you can draw in 2 am at night whenver everyone around you is asleep, it is all up to you to decide. With that being said, a part of drawing that can be helpful to come up with something is inspiration and the time and day could you help you in that aspect. </p>
            <p >For the time, it could help you with your inspiration of what to draw by setting the mood. If it's daytime, then it could you feel like you want to draw more happier and brighter things since the daytime is where most people are active. If it's night, then you could feel like drawing more darker or more calming things as in the night, it is dark and this is where people are at it's most calmest. The day itself could also help with inspiration since depending on what is the time of the year, it could help you set the mood on what you want to draw. An example of this is if it during October, then you might want to draw more scarier drawings since Halloween is during October. If its March 17th, then you might want to draw things that are green, due to the fact it is Saint Patrick's Day and that holiday is linked with the color green.</p>

        <section id="where">
            <h2>Best Locations to Draw</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/sunset.png" alt="sunset drawing">
                <figcaption><em>Drawing of a sunset that I drew when I was at the beach.</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p >Just like with time, there is no exact better location to draw at. Many people have there own perferences when it comes to drawing, from a cafe to an area at the park. As long as you are at a place where you are comfortable drawing and have a place where you can put your tools for drawing, then you should be good. By being able to find a more comfortable place to draw, you are able to put all of your focus on drawing without getting distracted.</p>
            <p >Just like the time, the place that you draw in could also give you inspiration on what should you draw and give you references to draw as well. An example of this is being at the beach and finding a shell that has a unique pattern. By finding that shell, it could give you the inspiration to draw it since you could be fascisnated by the design. The shell can also be a reference as well since you are able to look at it while you are drawing. Other examples of drawings based on locations include: a wine glass at a restaurant, a bird pecking at a tree in the park, and even the door in your room.</p>

            <p >No matter what hobby that you enjoy doing, you will almost always not do it good when you first start it. As you continue to do that hobby over and over again, you will eventually get better doing it and drawing is no exception. When you first start drawing, it would not be as good as you would want it to be. But as you continue to draw more and more, your drawings will improve more as well. In the next paragraph, we will talk about different kinds of techniques to improve your art.</p>
            <p >One technique you can do to help improve your art is to find different drawing tutorials. For this technique, you can look at what the person in the tutorial is doing when drawing and you can mimic on what they do for each step they do. When you are comfortable enough, eventually you can memomorize the steps of the tutorial and do them yourself until you are able to draw without the tutorial. Another technique you can do is to explore different art styles and the find the ones that you feel the most comfortable with. For this technique, try to explore different kinds of art styles to get more experience with drawing and so you could have more variety of your drawing skills. Once you explored enough, try to find the art styles that you had the most fun drawing and continue to draw in those art styles as focusing on one or more art styles can cause you to get more pratice on drawing and could cause you to improve your skills as a drawer.</p>
