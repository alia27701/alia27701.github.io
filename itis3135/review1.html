        <p><b>Space or Uppercase:</b> I did not see any Uppercases or spaces in the files or folders.</p>

        <h3>Design:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Contrast/Font Sizing:</b> No issues with the contrast as it is easy to read. I would recommend him to make the font size much more larger to make it more easier to read.</li>
            <li><b>Site Color/Font:</b> The page uses site colors and fonts are from the standard default.css file.</li>
            <li><b>CRAP:</b>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Contrast:</b> The contrast is really good. The text doesn't blend with the background and the different elements are in different fonts from each other.</li>
                    <li><b>Repetition:</b> The color schemes are the same for each page and he uses the same size fonts as well. Only issue is that he has h1 tags in some pages and no h1 in others.</li>
                    <li><b>Alignment:</b> Four out of the five pages are in left-centered while the media page is in the center. Regardless, they are all line up neatly.</li>
                    <li><b>Proximity:</b> The parts that are related are group nicely and the parts that are different are spaced enough to know that they are different sections.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>The Other Checklist parts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Header/Main/Footer:</b> He doesn't have a header or footer tag but makes up with it by using dynamic headers and footers. He has a main tag.</li>
            <li><b>H1:</b> The header does not contain h1 with the site title and for some pages, he does have the page name as the h1.</li>
            <li><b>H2:</b> Four out of the five pages do start the main content begins with an h2. The portfolio page starts with an h1.</li>
            <li><b>Footer:</b> The page has the correct links with the brand website and responsive web design, but has no css or html validation links.</li>
            <li>I have emailed Abdiel about this review.</li>
